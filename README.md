# 🎨 GAN-Style-Steganography: Coverless Data Hiding via Style Transfer

> An unofficial, enhanced PyTorch implementation of the paper *"Image Steganography and Style Transformation Based on Generative Adversarial Network" (Li et al., 2024)*. 

This project introduces a "Coverless" steganography paradigm by embedding secret messages directly during the neural style transfer process using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). By eliminating the original "natural image" baseline, it provides **Plausible Deniability** against modern steganalysis. 

Furthermore, this repository enhances the original paper's architecture by introducing a **Channel Coding (Repetition Code) mechanism**, achieving a **100% message recovery rate** in practical text transmissions.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Coverless Steganography:** The model does not modify an existing cover image. Instead, it generates a stylized stego image from scratch, making comparison-based steganalysis highly difficult.
* **4-Part GAN Architecture:** Integrates a Generator (Message-Embedding), an Extractor (Message-Extraction), a Discriminator (SRNet Steganalyzer), and a pre-trained VGG-19 Loss Network.
* **SRNet Discriminator:** Uses the state-of-the-art SRNet architecture as an adversarial discriminator to ensure the generated stego images are statistically indistinguishable from clean style-transferred images.
* **Error Correction via Channel Coding:** Implements Majority Voting to correct pixel-level interpretation errors, boosting raw bit accuracy from ~92.5% to a perfect 100% payload recovery.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Methodology


The framework optimizes a complex objective function balancing artistic style, content preservation, message recovery, and security against the steganalyzer:

$$L_{total} = \alpha L_{cont} + \beta L_{sty} + \lambda L_{ext} - \gamma L_{adv}$$

* **$L_{cont}$ (Content Loss):** Ensures the output maintains the structural elements of the original photo.
* **$L_{sty}$ (Style Loss):** Ensures the output adopts the desired artistic texture (calculated via Gram Matrices).
* **$L_{ext}$ (Extraction Loss):** Guarantees accurate recovery of the hidden data by the receiver.
* **$L_{adv}$ (Adversarial Loss):** Evaluates the Discriminator's ability to classify the output; maximized for the Generator to confuse the SRNet.

# 📊 Experimental Results
Based on our testing and evaluation phase:

Visual Fidelity: Achieved a PSNR of 21.5 dB, rendering the steganographic modifications visually coherent with standard artistic transfers.

Raw Bit Accuracy: The base model achieves ~92.5% physical layer accuracy for text bits.

Enhanced Recovery: With Channel Coding enabled, the system successfully corrects the remaining ~7.5% error margin, yielding 100% Message Recovery.

Security Rating: The SRNet discriminator detection rate hovers around 60%, closely approaching the ideal Nash Equilibrium of 50% (random guessing).
